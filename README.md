## Web-Design-Final
### Introduction: This is a website that help people to test their ability to recognize AIGC. So it is first a brief main website about what is AIGC and what is is hard to recognize. And then is several pages about a test about whether you can recognize AIGC or not. 
### For this project, I mainly focus on the Javascript of my project. I linked p5js with my website and also I used many Javascript effects. For example, the background sketch will change with your test results.
